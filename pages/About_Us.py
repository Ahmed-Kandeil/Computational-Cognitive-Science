    """
    The Computational Cognitive Science (CCS) project is a culmination of my interest 
    in data science and artificial intelligence. The project revolves around the implementation
    of various Naive Bayes classifiers, with a particular focus on solving equations in Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) and related fields.

    **Objectives:**
    - Implement and analyze the performance of different Naive Bayes classifiers.
    - Apply these classifiers to solve equations in NLP and other relevant domains.
    - Gain practical insights into the application of machine learning algorithms.

    **Expected Outcomes:**
    By the end of the project, I aim to become a proficient Data Scientist with a deeper
    understanding of the practical aspects of implementing machine learning models, especially
    Naive Bayes classifiers.
